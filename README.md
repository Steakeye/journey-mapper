# journey-mapper
Maps user journey by downloading static html + asset.

## Problem
Support teams need co-browser environments to deal with customer help enquiries efficiently. These need to reflect production releases a.s.a.p.

## Issue
Out of date screen shots or inappropriate user journeys, based on future prototypes) are used by business to investigate or support user issues. In a large scale enterprise system manually taking screen shots is laborious and inefficient and highlights the need for automation.

## Solution
Generate data-less static html from user journeys, from journey config files.

### Processes
TBD

### Note
This is a refactored app based upon the proof of concept [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) user-script code [HTML-Scraper](https://github.com/mattpepper/html-scraper/).
